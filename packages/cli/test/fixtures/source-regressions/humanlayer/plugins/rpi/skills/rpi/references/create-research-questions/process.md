# Create Research Questions

Turn the user's task into focused questions about how the current system works. These questions give the next research session its scope and starting points.

Follow these steps in order.

## 1. Read the Request

Read the files and sources the user names in full. Preserve exact paths, package names, repository names, and URLs as context pointers for the research agent.

Use the task directory and chosen flow established by `/rpi`.

## 2. Check Enough Context to Ask Good Questions

Do lightweight research to locate the relevant code and understand the request. Use subagents where useful:

- `codebase-locator` finds related source files, configuration, and tests.
- `codebase-analyzer` explains current behavior and interactions with file and line references.
- `codebase-pattern-finder` finds related implementations and conventions.
- `web-search-researcher` checks external web sources and library documentation when needed.

If an Explore agent/tool is available, you can use that too.

Use available web or library-documentation tools for external questions. When web access is unavailable, note that limit and continue with code and local documentation.

Keep this pass small; the next research session does the full investigation.

## 3. Draft Current-State Questions

Ask what exists, where it lives, and how it works today. Cover the relevant behavior, data flow, tests, constraints, edge cases, and library capabilities. Frame each question as a descriptive question about the existing system, keeping future design choices for the design phase.

Use concrete starting points: "In `packages/ui`, how does the theme reach shared components?" or "How does the worker recover queued jobs after a restart?"

Usually write two to seven questions, with more when the task warrants it. Match the scope and depth to the task.

For frontend work, include the existing design system: components, colors and hex codes, typography, spacing, borders, shadows, and theming. This gives later mockups the project's visual conventions.

## 4. Read the Template and Save the Questions

After reading the request and checking the context, read `$SKILLBASE/references/create-research-questions/references/research_questions_template.md`. When starting a change, also read `$SKILLBASE/references/create-research-questions/references/request_template.md` and save the original request in `NN-request-<description>.md` for later design and implementation sessions. Keep the user's desired result and exact source pointers there.

Write `NN-research-questions-<description>.md` in the selected task directory, using the next available number and a short kebab-case description.

Include context pointers when the request supplies them. Give the research session self-contained, neutral questions and concrete source pointers; keep the desired change in the separate request document so research stays objective.

## 5. Read the Final-Answer Template and Respond

Read `$SKILLBASE/references/create-research-questions/references/research_questions_final_answer.md` and respond using that template, filling in the saved file path, task directory, and chosen flow.

Offer to open the document for review in VS Code, Cursor, or the user's preferred editor or browser.

Finish this phase with the saved questions and suggested research command, then wait for the user's request to begin research.
